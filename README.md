# Face-Recognition

part1-part2 and part3 is about accessing to the camera, face detection, eye detection,mouth etc.. with Haar Cascades.
After we start to run part4.. all the pictures that we take by camera goes into the data2 folder(that was the folder that I've created it you could name whatever you want,and after that..we have to run 'classifier' to get ' .yml' folder.. which will be using at part5.. the program is able to recognize us with the data that we have given at part5..
